			<h3>What is EZcheck?</h3>
			
			<p>
			Library catalogs can contain tens of thousands of links to external resources. Most ILS systems provide no easy way to check whether those links
			are broken, and doing it manually is not feasible. With easy check, it's simple. Load all your catalog records containing hyperlinks as a .MRC file
			or as a delimited text file, and EZcheck will quickly generate an output file showing the status of all those links. If you use the Sierra ILS,
			EZcheck can connect directly to the underlying PostgreSQL database automatically to fetch all the records containing hyperlinks.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			EZcheck works by searching a MARC 856 field for a hyperlink and making an HTTP HEAD request to the external resource. EZcheck records the HTTP status code 
			of the response along with a short description of that code. You can easily sort the output using a spreadsheet program like Excel to find 404s and other
			nasty error codes.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Although EZcheck is design to work with MARC catalog records, it can be used to check any links whatsoever. You can upload a tab-delimited text file 
			of hyperlinks and let EZcheck do its thing. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			One of the highlights of EZcheck is that it is multi-threaded. That means it can check many links simultaneously. When it encounters a stubborn link 
			that takes ages to load, the program won't come screeching to a halt. That individual thread will wait on the slow resource, while other threads 
			continue checking other links. The result is that EZcheck takes only a fraction of the time it would normally take to process all those links with a 
			single-threaded program. When you are working with tens of thousands of links, many hours of time can be saved.
			</p>
